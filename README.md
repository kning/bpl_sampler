# Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) Sampler

One (corny) hip hop beat and two sampler instruments using recorded audio from two participants in Brooklyn Public Library's, [Our Streets, Our Stories](http://www.bklynlibrary.org/seniors/our-streets-our-stories-o). 

##Purpose
Both NYPL and BPL have incredibly rich collections of oral histories, but raw, unstructured, 40 minute interviews of strangers is not engaging content in a traditional sense. How can music augment these peoples' stories and encourage others to connect more with their experiences?

Hip hop has always been an excellent medium for storytelling. Sampling in particular has proven to be very successful in re-interpreting past culture in a fresh way (e.g. [speeches](http://genius.com/2333915), [movies](http://genius.com/89864), and [other musical traditions](http://genius.com/4724462)). Perhaps we can use a similar technique to re-interpret these oral histories and breathe new meaning into them.

##The Sampler Instruments
The basis of these sampler instruments were two interviews: [Mary Needelman](https://github.com/nypl-openaudio/data-brooklyn-public-library/blob/master/transcripts/text/marty-needelman-0001.text) and [Inez Spencer](https://github.com/nypl-openaudio/data-brooklyn-public-library/blob/master/transcripts/text/inez-spencer-0001.text).
